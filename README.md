# Tree distributions from EU_forest
+ get the spatial potins of 242 tree species from EU-forest
+ use 4 resolutions (1, 5, 10, 20 km) to rasterize distribution occurrences
+ get the coordinates of each rasterized occurreces
+ get the environmental conditions for each occurrences, including human footprint in 2009 and bioclimates 1-19.
+ the final tree distribution data is "tree_occs_cells" in the "EU_tree_distributions_environments.RDATA".
